Welcome! This is my development environment.

To get started, run the following commands after getting into a `bash` shell:
1) `nix-shell`
2) `sh hack.sh`

Doing that will load everything and get it rolling.

Check out the `startup.sh` script for a simple script that will pull down and clone the dev environment.
