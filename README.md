Welcome! This is my development environment. It's an attempt to be reproducible across the various devices I'll be hacking on. 

# Installation 
* Install Nix 
* Copy `startup.sh` into a local file at the directory you want to use
* Add a `.gitignore` entry for the `.dev_env` folder
* Run the `startup.sh` to begin

# Useful commands
* `M-x slime` to launch a Slime REPL instance with Common Lisp
